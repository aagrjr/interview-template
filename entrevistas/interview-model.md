This is a model of tech interviews created by Fernando Gomes <tech.fernando.gomes@gmail.com>

This model is destinated to be a part of validation of the tech skills of the candidate, but maybe can touch some soft skill as well.
Generally a HR person is present to ask the philosofy questions, work day, contract and everything.
Its common to have separated meeting to talk about other stuff, and just focus now in the tech subjects.

This steps are more focused on Backend using Java but also can be used in a Node Env.
In parts it also can be used to Front or FullStack interview.
