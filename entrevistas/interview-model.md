#. About 

This is a technical interview template created by Fernando Gomes <tech.fernando.gomes@gmail.com>

This template is intended to be part of validating the candidate's technical skills, but perhaps could also touch on some soft skills.
Usually an HR person is present to ask the philosophical questions, working processes, contract and everything.
Its common to have separated meeting to talk about other things, and just focus now on just the tech stuff.

These steps are more focused on Backend using Java and micro services but also can be used in a Kotlin, NodeJS and other similar tech and approachs.
In parts it can also be used for Front or FullStack interviews.

Suggested time:
- For Junior: 30-60min
- For Mid level: 45-60min
- For Seniors: 60-90min
- For Specialist/Architect/Lead: 90-120min
